            	Currently around 1.4 billion people in the world still have no access to power and 400
				million of them live in rural areas of India. In India per capita consumption in rural
				households is only 8 units per month as compared to 24 units in urban households. The 
				reason for such low level of consumption is not low demand, but poor and unreliable supply of electricity. Poor access to energy facilities in rural areas is a result of poor grid connectivity and lack of distribution network for renewable and clean energy technologies.
