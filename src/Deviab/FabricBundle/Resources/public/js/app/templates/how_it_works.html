	<div>&nbsp &nbsp Lytyfy helps in facilitating end user financing for rural customers who are willing to adopt clean and green technologies but are restricted due to availability of capital at once. Rural households who are interested in adopting solar technology are identified after conducting proper due diligence. Based on the seasonal cashflows of the family, the exact amount that the families can invest is identified and the ability of the family to repay in monthly instalments is also found out. A survey of a rural area is conducted to understand the overall energy scenario in the village or the panchayat.

	<div>&nbsp &nbsp Based on the energy scenario, estimation of no. of families which will be interested in adopting solar home lighting system is carried out. The seasonal cash flows of these households in created and the purchasing power of these households is estimated. The households are given the option of payments in instalments if their seasonal cashflows do not support a one time payment for the solar home lighting system. The profiles of the families who request for instalment option are put up on Lytyfy and the money raised will used for purchasing solar home lighting systems which will be installed in the households of low income families. The rural household shall return the money to the social investor in monthly instalments. It is to be noted that even for availing payments through instalment option, the rural  customer has to give a cash down payment of at least 50% of the cost of the solar home lighting system and only the remaining shall be provided as a loan which shall be allowed to repay in monthly instalments. The interest that will be charged to the rural customer will be 2% per month. The interest rate that shall be provided to the social investor will be 0.60% per month. The difference between the two interest rates will be utilised for facilitating the transactions and the whole process.
